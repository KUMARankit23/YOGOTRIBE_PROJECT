🚀 Getting Started with Create React App
Welcome! 👋
This project was set up using Create React App, a great way to kickstart your React journey with zero build config headaches.

📜 Available Scripts
Once you're in the project directory, you can run the following commands:

🔧 npm start
Starts the development server.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action!

The page automatically reloads if you make changes.

Any linting errors will show up in the console.

✅ npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Perfect for running tests while you're developing.

🏗️ npm run build
Prepares your app for production!
It creates an optimized, minified build in the build/ folder.

Filenames include hashes for caching.

Your app will be lightning-fast and ready to deploy.

⚠️ npm run eject
Heads up! This is a one-way operation – you can't undo this.

If you ever feel limited by CRA's default setup, you can eject to take full control of the config (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.). This copies everything into your project so you can customize as needed.

That said, ejecting is totally optional. For most apps, the out-of-the-box configuration works just fine.
