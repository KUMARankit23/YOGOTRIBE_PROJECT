# YOGOTRIBE_PROJECT
1. Frontend Challenge (React/Vue/Angular): Create a very simple web page with a single button. When the button is clicked, it should fetch a random "fact" from a public API (e.g., https://catfact.ninja/fact for cat facts, or a similar simple public API) and display it on the page. Use async/await for the API call.  AND ALSO THE BACKEND PROJECT
